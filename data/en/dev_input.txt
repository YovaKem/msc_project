Despina Pappa-Paschalidou 
Despina Pappa - Paschalidou ( Chalcedon 1874 – Athens 1954 ) was a Greek doll maker . 
Biography . 
Despina Pappa - Paschalidou was born in 1874 in ancient Chalcedon ( Kadikoy ) . Her father , Georgios Pappas , was a merchant from the island of Chios and owner of one of the biggest shops in Constantinople ( Galata ) , founded in 1852 , which sold felt and fabric. Her mother , Eleni Logaridou , was born in Fanari ( Fener ) . She was raised in a large , prosperous , urban family. Despina was privately educated at home and her studies included Greek , French and piano. She also showed interest and skills in drawing , frequently inspired by the landscapes that were depicted on postcards . 
In 1897 she married Konstantinos Paschalidis , a businessman who had studied at the School of Agriculture of the University of Montpellier and with whom she had four daughters : Eleni ( Zongolopoulou ) , Danae ( Nikolaidi ) , Lili ( Theodoridou ) , and Alexandra ( Moreti ) . Konstantinos Paschalidis owned a sericulture business in silkworm cocoons and silk seeds. His businesses were located in Redestos ( East Thraki ) , in Kios ( Asia Minor ) and in Teheran ( Persia ) . He was a pioneer since he was the first to make use of the Pasteur method and microscopic examination of the butterflies . 
His successful business was interrupted in 1919 after the Russian Revolution due to the fact that the main roads which enabled trade to Europe were closed. Paschalidis will close his factory in Persia , while a characteristic fact about his business took place in Baku , Azerbaijan , where an entire railway that transferred the yearly production of his factory in Teheran , silkworm cocoons and silk seeds , was seized. That fact had a considerable economic impact for Paschalidis . 
In 1922 the Paschalidis family moved from Constantinople ( Istanbul ) to Bulgaria ( Varna ) , then to Thessaloniki and finally to Athens in 1925 , where they settled permanently , and at this point most likely began Despina Paschalidou’s motivation for financial independence . 
In the mid-20’s , Despina Paschalidou decided to make dolls in order to earn some money. She designed both the dolls and their clothing which was inspired mainly by Greek costumes. Despina sold her dolls in touristic shops near the Acropolis . 
In 1930 she participated with her crafts in the Industrial Exhibition of Delphi. Despina’s dolls were also presented at the Annual Exhibition of Traditional Art at Zappeio. She co-operated professionally with the first touristic shop in Greece , owned by Florentini Kaloutsi . 
The dolls were dressed in traditional clothes from different parts of Greece and Anatolia as well as urban dress. Despina’s inspiration derived from everyday people of Athens’ life such as a tavern boy , a shoemaker , a baker , etc. Often her dolls would illustrate comical and funny features of people , such as the “Menidiatis” , holding a spit of meat , and the “Delapatridis”. Moreover , one of the Greek ministers ordered an oversized doll named “Othonas” and offered it as a present to the Prime Minister of Greece , Eleftherios Venizelos . 
In 1934 , Despina Paschalidou , now a prominent doll maker , decided to create a workshop in her house and eventually hired ten women , all of them refugees from Asia Minor , to work for her business. This workshop also produced dolls without clothes that were exported to the American Near East Foundation. The workshop developed successfully for five years until circumstances during World War II did not allow further operation . 
After the production and trade of dolls , Despina Paschalidou turned to writing down and illustrating the tales from Constantinople that her aunt , Chariklia Pappa , used to tell her as a child. In 1939 Pirsos Publications printed her work with the title “Tales of Our People” . 
Privately she continued making dolls , put on puppet shows with her grandchildren , painted , and noted recipes and traditions of her home country. It was Despina who urged her daughter Lili Paschalidou - Theodoridou to get involved with the craft of doll making in 1948-9 and who inspired her daughter Eleni Paschalidou – Zongolopoulou to study the art of drawing . 
She died in 1954 , in Athens . 
A part of Despina Pappa - Paschalidou’ s work is held in the Benaki Museum in the Museum’s Permanent Collection of Toys and Childhood , as well as in several private collections . 
Despina’s daughter , Alexandra Paschalidou – Moreti , reissued the tales of her mother in 1990 and 2000 titled “Tales of Constantinople” .

PhantomJS is a headless WebKit with a JavaScript API that allows you to work with that browser. If you’re asking “Headless” WebKit ? then try to think of it this way : it’s like Chrome with no window , no browser chrome , and an invisible viewport ( Faith-based browsing ) . It’s a command-line utility into which you can feed JavaScript-based programs for performing a variety of tasks that browsers and JavaScript engines are otherwise well-suited to . 
Observe this totally contrived example :

In that script we : 
Create one of PhantomJS’s WebPage objects ; 
Load the main URL for this blog ; 
After the landing page loads , we grab all the headlines ; 
Output the text of those headlines to the console ; and 
Exit from PhantomJS . 
The above demonstrates just a few of the basics of the PhantomJS API. You can let your imagination run wild with this ; it’s possible to use it for SVG rendering , site crawling and scraping , network monitoring , and–of course–headless testing .

Spring Hill Farm ( Ellicott City , Maryland ) 
The Springfield Farm , is a historic slave plantation located in Ellicott City in Howard County , Maryland , United States . 
The site south of the Patapsco River produced Native American arrowheads in routine farming. The farm is part of a 1695 900 acre land patent named `` Chew 's Resolution Manor '' . The property was a gift of Caleb Dorsey of Belmont to his daughter Rebbecca and her husband Charles Ridgely creating the parcel `` Rebbecca 's Lot '' . The main house was built about 1804. The property contains the Spring Hill quarters , a stone structure dating to 1790 built originally as a home for Edward Hill Dorsey. The structure has served as slave quarters , a carriage house with modern remodeling of the interior in the 1950s . 
The farm was later owned by the Clark family who also resided to the south at Fairfield Farm. Owner Garnett `` Booker '' Clark used the outbuildings to make and store whiskey during prohibition. Garnett 's brother James `` Booker '' Clark maintained his credibility as a revenue officer by destroying the operation. About ten outbuildings of the farm are identified in 1790 tax rolls. By the 1970s the farm had been subdivided down to two parcels totaling 11 acres , with a large power-line easement and the New Cut Landfill facility occupying the northern tracts . 
In the year 2000 , Glen Mar Church purchased 21 acres of the farmland from the Baugher family with an address of 4701 New Cut Road. In 2004 groundbreaking occurred and in 2008 the church relocated to the site from Glen Mar Road .

Hagen Stehr 
Hagen Stehr AO ( born 1941 ) is a German-born multi-millionaire businessman , tuna fisherman and founder of the Stehr Group. He lives in Port Lincoln , South Australia where he manages his business interests in fishing and aquaculture , most notably Southern bluefin tuna ( Thunnus maccoyii ) fishing and offshore ranching in Spencer Gulf for export markets. The Stehr Group also propagates and grows Australian Yellowtail Kingfish ( Seriola lalandi ) and Australian Mulloway ( Argyrosomus hololepidotus ) through its aquaculture division ,  Clean Seas Aquaculture Growout Pty. Ltd. One of the wealthiest men in South Australia ,  Mr Stehr is also chairman of the Australian Maritime & Fisheries Academy. The Stehr Group has a commercial fleet of nine vessels . 
Stehr is sometimes referred to colloquially as a `` tuna baron '' or `` tuna king '' , a term representative of the profitability of the business. He has previously boasted that when he sits down with his friends Sam Sarin , Mario Valcic and Joe Puglisi , they are worth more than a billion dollars between them. According to the BRW Australian rich list , his personal wealth was approximately $ US135 million in 2009. In 2014 , Stehr participated in a trade delegation to China with Australia 's Prime Minister , Tony Abbott as an ambassador for the seafood industry . 
Early life . 
Stehr left home at the age of 12 to join the merchant marines , then jumped from job to job working on cargo ships. He absconded at Port Lincoln at the age of 18 , where he met his wife Anna and became a tuna fisherman in 1961. He arrived in Port Lincoln with little money and no employment prospects. He is also a former member of the French Foreign Legion . 
Research & development . 
Hagen Stehr through his company Clean Seas Tuna has invested in attempts to close the life cycle of the Southern blue-fin tuna by propagating them in a land-based tank. The tank 's waters were climatically controlled to simulate the experience of wild fish traversing long distances and varied oceanic conditions. The mature fish required for the research were air-lifted to the facility from grow-out pens at sea by helicopter. The research was conducted in partnership with Kinki University , Japan and over the first four and a half years , $ 4.5 million was raised through government bodies. The Fisheries Research & Development Corporation ( FRDC ) and the Government of South Australia 's Department of Trade & Economic Development ( now the Department of State Development ) were among them . 
Political views . 
Stehr has stated that his tuna business is `` beholden to Japan '' and has welcomed the prospect of a Free Trade Agreement with China and reduced tariffs. He believes accessing markets in China and Korea will be instrumental to the future success of his business. He believes that seafood from Eyre peninsula and Port Lincoln comes from `` without doubt the cleanest waters '' and is harvested sustainably . 
Western Australian shark cull . 
Stehr has publicly supported the culling of protected Great white sharks during the controversial Western Australian shark cull in 2014. He had previously complained to the media about `` shark attacks and tuna disappearing '' saying that his company `` fought against White pointers . '' 
Super-trawler FV Margiris . 
In 2012 , Stehr spoke out against the approval of the super-trawler FV Margiris to fish in Australian waters , saying `` The Australian government is the only one stupid enough to take it ... Those ding-a-lings from AFMA ( Australian Fisheries Management Authority ) in Canberra shouldn’t let a ship like that in. It wasn’t welcome anywhere else . '' 
Honours . 
Hagen Heinz Stehr was awarded Officer of the Order of Australia on Australia Day , 1997. He received the award for service to the commercial fishing industry and to education and training , particularly through the South Australian Fishing and Seafood Industry Skills Centre Inc .

Anna Mae O'Dowd 
Anna Mae O'Dowd played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League from 1949 to 1951. She was born in Chicago , Illinois on April 26 , 1929. She both batted and threw right-handed . 
Baseball career .

According to fellow player Lois Balchunas ( Bellman ) , `` Anna Mae O'Dowd was a catcher and was she good . '' 
What was great for Anna about her professional baseball career -- apart from participating in the game -- was the travel. She had never left the Chicago area and was delighted to be able to travel so much. During her three years as a catcher for the league , she visited 27 different states. Once she left the league , later on in life , she played fast pitch softball with the Bloomer Girls in Chicago. They would play at night , which meant she could still work during the day . 
Retirement . 
In 1992 , once she had retired , Anna played golf and pickle ball. She still had the travel bug and visited many parts of the country. One of these trips was in 2006 when she went to Cooperstown , New York , where she attended the unveiling of the AAGPBL batter commemorative statue , in honour of the League .

In January 1804 , at age 20 , he was appointed secretary to the political mission sent by the British government to Ali Pasha and the Turkish governors of the Morea and other provinces , with a view to counteracting the influence of France in south-east Europe. In May 1807 he was ordered to take entire charge of the mission , but the continuing rupture of diplomatic relations between England and the Ottoman Empire defeated his negotiations . 
Morier was shortly transferred to Sir Arthur Paget 's mission , at the Dardanelles. He was despatched on special service to Egypt , where he was instructed to negotiate for the release of the British prisoners captured by Muhammed Ali during the Alexandria expedition of 1807. In the summer of 1808 he was attached to Robert Adair 's embassy , and with Stratford Canning , assisted in negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of the Dardanelles of 5 January 1809. Back in Constantinople , with the exception of a mission to Tabriz from October 1809 to the following summer , he remained at the embassy , first under Adair , and then ( 1810–12 ) as secretary of legation under his successor , Stratford Canning . 
At the end of Canning 's appointment , Morier accompanied him ( July 1812 ) on his return to England. In 1813 he was attached to Lord Aberdeen 's mission to Vienna , and during the years 1813-1815 was employed in the negotiations around the fall of Napoleon. He was with Lord Castlereagh at the conferences at Chatillon-sur-Seine , and assisted in the preparation of the Treaty of Paris ( 1814 ) . In the same year he attended the foreign minister at the Congress of Vienna , and , when the Duke of Wellington succeeded Castlereagh , Morier remained as one of the secretaries. In July 1815 , after the final overthrow of Napoleon , Morier accompanied Castlereagh to Paris , and was occupied till September in drafting the Treaty of Paris ( 1815 ) . 
Appointed consul-general for France in November 1814 , Morier did not take up the post until September1815 , when his work on the treaties was completed. At the same time he was named a commissioner for the settlement of the claims of British subjects on the French government. The consul-generalship was abolished , and Morier retired on a pension 5 April 1832 , but was almost immediately ( 5 June ) appointed minister plenipotentiary to the Swiss Confederated States. He then resided in Berne for 15 years . 
On 19 June 1847 , at the age of 63 , Morier retired from the diplomatic service. He died in London 13 July 1877 at the age of 93 . 
Works . 
Morier published two pamphlets , `` What has Religion to do with Politics ? '' ( London , 1848 ) , and `` The Basis of Morality '' ( London , 1869 ) . At the age of 73 he published a novel , `` Photo , the Suliote , a Tale of Modern Greece '' , London , 1857. Material for the story came from a Greek physician with whom Morier was spent a period of quarantine at Corfu . 
Some letters written by Morier at Tabriz were published in Stanley Lane-Poole 's `` Life of Stratford Canning '' . 
Family .

Miroslav Hubmajer 
Miroslav Hubmajer , slovenian officer and volunteer in Herzegovina Uprising , * 1851 † 1910 . 
Hubmajer Miroslav , born on 3 January 1851 in Ljubljana , died on 1 March 1910 in Sarajevo. Trained for a typesetter , 
worked in Graz , Budapest and elsewhere. During military service in Austrian army he received rank of reserve lower officer. He served as a gunner and was studying the mechanics and applied for several patents. When he returned from military service he started working for National Printing House ( Narodna tiskarna ) in Ljubljana. The printworkers at that time were well organized , informed and educated and Miroslav Hubmajer joined the printworkers organization. A lot of printworkers volunteered in the Herzegovina uprising as did Miroslav Hubmajer who went to Herzegovina in Mai 1876. At the assembly of rebels in Jamnica was 
elected against Peter Mrkonjić ( later Serbian king Petar I. Karadjordjević ) for chief 
commander of all rebel troops although he was not recognized as leader of adherents of Peter Mrkonjić. The Turks launched at his head high reward. In the 
Serbo-Turkish war he joined Serbian army , became artillery officer and later fled with 
Nikola Pašić to Bucharest , where he founded a lithographic institute. Later he got a job in Belgrade and was editor Belgrader Zeitung. Together with Vaso Pelagićem in 1884 writes the declaration for Balkan-Karpathian federation. In 1896 he got a job in the regional museum in Sarajevo and was as good expert adviser of 
Austro-Hungarian ministry of finance and administrator of the 
Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina , 
Beni Kallay . 
Hubmajer Miroslav from Ljubljana or `` Black Miroslav , '' as he was 
called by rebels , was among all slovenian volunteers in Herzegovina Uprising best known. He served as an 
artillery NCO in Segedin , where he became acquainted with the Serbs. He was by 
profession a typesetter and when he was 24 year old he joined the 
Herzegovina Uprising , where he soon acquired the reputation of the hero. Stories about 
his military achievements thewere circulating among the people of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and also European newspapers wrote about it . 
Hubmajers first military activities were around Trebinje in 
Herzegovina. Later he travelled 
with dr. Kosta Grujić to Montenegro as delegate of the uprising movement to Montenegrin prince 
Nikola to get the support in the war against 
Turks. The duke Vrbič , Minister of 
the Interior , kindly accepted them and presented them to all the nobility and 
guests on the Montenegrin court. Hubmajer received there from duke Vrbič in 
recognition of his merits in the struggle against the Turks a gun belt and 
60 bullets. Later he was sent to Una region in Bosnia to 
start , organize and command the uprising in that region. Meanwhile , it has been recognized by 
rebels that individual troops can not achieve strategic success in battle against 
the Turks. Therefore , gathered in Jamnica , west from Una , 85 
rebel leaders , to elect a chief commander and determine the battle plan. At this assembly 
was also Peter Mrkonjić and some have suggested him for the chief commander 
because he was the grandson of Karadjordje and like volunteer bravely fought 
in the French army against Prussians and proved his heroism in battle on the 
river Loire. But volunteers at the assembly were not in accordance ; the small majority 
were supporters of prince Milan of Serbia , on opposite side were also supporters of 
Peter Mrkonjić , who were in the minority , and few supporters of Austria. Among the 
latter leading role was played by Peter Uzelac , whom have joined some of the 
followers of the prince of Milan and this way he succeeded to prevent the 
election of Peter Mrkonjić for the main leader. Thus , for the head of rebels was 
selected slovenian Miroslav Hubmajer. As commander he led then fierce battles near Jamnica and tried to 
take the Kostajnica. When it failed , he hit with his troops the Turk troops in 
Topola , two hours away from Jamnica and succeeded the great victory over them . 
Under the influence of this victory the rebels oath on the flag that they will 
fight to the last rather than to admit and suffer the Turkish dominion . 
Hubmajer later , when in 1876 when Serbia declared war to Turkey , participated in 
the fighting at Javor and Deligrad. Russian general Mikhail Chernyayev , 
who came with volunteers from Russia to help Serbia and became the chief commander of the 
Serbian army , has raised him to the rank of lieutenant because of his abilities .

By association we mean creating any kind of link between our previous knowledge and the new word to help us find out and/or remember the meaning of the new word. This technique which has a strong psychological basis is a lot of fun , especially for adult learners whose knowledge of the world is much greater than that of kids ( Ahmadvand , 2000 ) . The following are some mnemonic devices and examples as how to create links : 
a ) Breaking the words : Sometimes if you break the words into parts , their meanings become clear. Break , for instance , `` Russian '' into Russ + ian , or `` pressure '' into press + ure , or `` luxury '' into lux + ury , and so on. Russ in Farsi means from the country Russia ( روسی ) , press in Farsi means put something on another thing forcefully ( فشار دادن ) , and lux in Farsi means something which is beautiful and expensive but not necessary ( لوکس وتجملاتی ) . From the meaning of the parts familiar to us , we can arrive at the meaning of the words themselves. Do you know the meaning of `` alpinism '' ? Now break it into alp + inism. What is `` alp '' ? Yes , it is the name of a mountain , and alpinism means climbing mountains ! 
b ) Adding to words : Sometimes you can arrive at the meaning of a word by adding prefixes or suffixes or other words to it. For example , `` adapt '' means adjust , like an `` adaptor '' which adjusts the electric current of some devices. Or `` ultimate '' means last , and we know that `` ultimatum '' means the last chance given. We can infer that `` ham '' is a kind of meat because `` hamburger '' is a kind of food made of meat. We can deduce that `` gentle '' means calm and kind because a `` gentleman '' is a person who is kind and calm and well-behaved . 
c ) Playing with words : Try to find interesting points , stories , or examples for words so that you will remember them more easily. For example , `` Christian '' is similar to `` Christmas '' ; Christmas is the new year celebration of مسیحیان , so Christian means مسیحی . A digital watch shows the time by using numbers , so `` digit '' means number. The word `` ambulance '' is a mobile or moving hospital , so `` ambulant '' means mobile or سیّار . 
Now think about the following words and try to find something interesting related to them : village , army , clip , chip , balance , contract , folk , and human . 
d ) Attending to the sounds of words : Some words are formed from their sounds. Words like `` chick '' which reminds us of جیک جیک جوجه , `` pick up '' which is the sound we hear when we pick up a telephone receiver , and `` cough '' which means سرفه کردن . 
e ) Finding patterns among words : There are some words which have similar patterns. These patterns are very interesting and make learning more interesting. We present two patterns as examples . 
The first pattern includes words which have different and new meanings when they are used in the plural form : 
wood چوب – جنگل woods جنگل good خوب goods کالا means وسیله mean معنی دادن – منظور 
The second pattern comprises words which have different and new meanings when they are capitalized : 
polish جلا دادن Polish لهستانی ottoman مبل Ottoman عثمانی hungry گرسنه Hungary مجارستان

Angele Delanghe 
Angele Delanghe ( also sometimes Angèle Delanghe ) was a Belgian fashion designer based in London who ran an eponymous label from the late 1930s to the mid 1960s and also produced couture designs for the West End department store Fortnum & Mason . 
Early career . 
Delanghe was born in Belgium and came to the UK in 1914 , at the outbreak of World War I , as a refugee. She presented her first collection in London in 1939. While wartime interrupted the activities of all London 's couture houses , fashion went on and the influential Britrish `` Vogue '' editor Audrey Withers was described as being among her early fans. Delanghe was among the earlier members of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers ( IncSoc ) , joining in 1945 but withdrawing two years later due , reportedly , to financial dificulties . 
Brand hallmarks . 
Delanghe was known for her soft tailoring and feminine gowns – particularly romantic eveningwear and wedding dresses. At a January 1947 fashion show – in which she shared space and billing with fellow IncSoc member Charles Creed – Delanghe featured draped and brocaded evening gowns with stiffened hems slightly raised at the front , while daywear was characterised by simple designs with high necklines and checked and plaid fabrics. Her designs had broad appeal , a fashion writer in `` The Times '' noting in 1948 : `` Angele Delanghe has built her collection on the three Balzac types – the unmarried girl , the woman of 30 and the woman of the world '' . 
Later career . 
By 1949 , Delanghe was designing for Fortnum & Mason. Although she had resigned her membership of IncSoc , taking her out of the so called `` big ten '' of British fashion designers , her work was still considered important enough to regularly feature in newspaper reviews of the couture shows. That year , she presented a collection featuring lightweight woollen suits with soft sillhouettes , slim waists and pleated skirts. For the spring 1950 showed – designed for Fortnum & Mason – the reviewer noted her clever use of featherweight tweeds and worsteds , alongside cotton and linen and the fact that she had , as usual , designed with a focus on colour and suitability for the British climate . 
Delanghe continued to service a loyal client base from her Bruton Street showroom throughout the '50s , regularly announcing her new collections in the classified adverts section of `` The Times '' . She rejoined the Incorporated Society of Fashion Designers in 1961 – the first new member in eight years. A reviewer of her second show of the year noted that although she had established a reputation for beautiful workmanship and attracted a loyal client base to her salon in Bruton Street , this collection 's harem skirts , knickerbockers and stiff silk taffeta gowns was `` backward looking '' and out of keeping with the contemporary mood towards soft and flowing fashions . 
By this stage , Delanghe was part of the old guard , with a perspective of fashion design that was possibly out of keeping with the 1960s trend for androgynous shifts and mini skirts. She told a correspondent for `` The Times '' in January 1965 that models had neglected their waistlines , adding : `` I had to interview more than 20 girls for the show before I found one with a waist as slender as 23 inches '' . 
In 1966 , Delanghe withdrew her membership from IncSoc – this at a time when the whole British couture industry was struggling due to high taxation , a shrinking customer base and the rise of ready-to-wear .

Graphotype 
Graphotype was a process of autographic engraving , by which typographic printing blocks were produced . 
Process . 
A block of chalk or some similar material is reduced to a level surface. On this surface , a design is drawn with a glutinous ink , the ink being sufficiently fluid to penetrate some little distance into the porous chalk. The ink having become dry , gentle friction is applied to the surface of the block so as gradually to rub away those parts of the chalk which are not indurated by the glutinous ink. The lines of the drawing being thus left in relief , a perfect model of the required printing block is obtained and this model is next hardened by immersion in a bath containing a solution of an alkaline silicate. After this , the block is dried and reproduced by the stereotype or the electrotype process . 
This method of typographic engraving was brought to a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American wood engraver , Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock. The first step in his process is to reduce French chalk or talc to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings , elutriations , and siftings. After this is complete , a layer of the material ( over an eighth of an inch in thickness ) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick zinc plate , the necessary pressure being obtained by means of an hydraulic press , the platen of which is faced with a polished steel plate , so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed French chalk. The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of glue colored by lamp black or some other pigment. In drawing on the prepared block , care must be taken not to damage the somewhat tender surface of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine sable brush , but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of silk velvet or a fitch brush may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief , and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary playing card is produced , the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10 per cent solution of sodium silicate may be used for hardening the block and , when dry , nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal .

Pentavalent vaccine 
A Pentavalent vaccine is five individual vaccines conjugated in one intended to actively protect infant children from 5 potentially deadly diseases : Haemophilus Influenza type B ( the bacteria that causes meningitis , pneumonia and otitis ) , Whooping Cough ( or Pertussis ) , Tetanus , Hepatitis B and Diphtheria. During studies and tests , the conjugated liquid DTPw-HepB-Hib vaccine was found to have positive safety when administered as a booster to toddlers who have been given a vaccination course with another pentavalent booster that requires a change in constitution and was also found to be adequately immunogenic . 
The most widely administered Pentavalent vaccine globally - Quinvaxem has been administered to 400 million children as of 2013. This was after Crucell had procured an order worth US $ 110 million ( in 2010 ) from UNICEF for the distribution of the Quinvaxem vaccine for free to many of the developing nations. Apart from Quinvaxem ( DTwP ) , other major Pentavalent vaccines available include Pentavac PFS , Easyfive and Pentaxim ( DTaP ) . 
Quinvaxem . 
In March 2006 , the Korea Food and Drug Administration ( KFDA ) awarded Quinvaxem the rights to distribution and sale. The vaccine was being developed and manufactured by Crucell in Korea and was co-produced by Chiron Corporation ( that was eventually purchased by Novartis International AG on April 20 , 2006 ) , which provides four out of the five vaccine elements `` in bulk '' . 
Pentavac PFS . 
Pentavac PFS is the Pentavalent vaccine manufactured in India by Pune-based pharmaceutical company Serum Institute of India and remains the lowest cost pentavalent vaccine in India . 
Easyfive TT . 
Produced by Panacea Biotec , Easyfive was removed from the WHO 's list of pre-approved and prequalified vaccines in mid-2011. Thereafter , in September 2013 , WHO re-approved Easyfive after a positive result in the re-evaluation of the vaccine . 
History and Controversy . 
In India . 
Late 2013 , it was found that the Pentavalent vaccine manufacturer - The Serum Institute in India was distributing 2 sets of Pentavac PFS vaccines for administration. One set with manufacturing and expiry dates was being provided to private hospitals , while the other set without manufacturing and expiry dates was being distributed to government hospitals. It was later clarified that the dates not appearing on one set of vaccines did not contravene any regulations as they were supplied by UNICEF and was legal under Rule 94 applicable to exports under Indian Law . 
In Vietnam . 
Since the vaccine was first used in Vietnam in 2007 , an estimated 63 children have died post vaccination out of the total of 4.5 million vaccinations in Vietnam. Pentavalent vaccines were subsequently suspended by the Vietnamese Health Ministry in May 2013 after nine children died post-vaccination and increasing public dissent. However , the Quinvaxem vaccine was declared safe to use after public investigations showed that the fatalities reported in Vietnam were either coincidental health problems related in time but not related to the use of the pentavalent vaccine , or cases for which the information available does not allow for a definite conclusion. Thereafter , the WHO also released an online FAQ for Quinvaxem and its proper use resulting in the use of the vaccine being re-instated for the National Extended Vaccination program post October 2013 , nearly five months after its suspension .

Louise Cook 
Louise Cook made history in 2012 becoming the FIA Production car Cup for Drivers of 2WD Champion and importantly becoming the first female to lift an FIA Rally Championship Title not specifically made for women . 
Louise got her first taste of driving when her late father , Robert Cook , bought her a battery powered car on her 6th birthday. Louise and her pet rabbit would drive round for hours until the battery went flat. Louise wrote off the conservatory window twice , 2 garden fences and took the front axle clean off ! 
Louise’s first taste of rally driving was at 19 whilst studying Car Design at Coventry University. Louise saw a competition advertised to encourage more women into Rallying. Louise entered and found herself with an amazing 2nd place out of 1000 women , with no previous motorsport experience. This gave Louise the confidence to gain her rally licence and enter her first ever rally thanks to her student loan . 
Louise , desperate to finance a way of starting a career in rallying came up with an idea. Louise sold small spaces on her rally car with raffle prizes for larger spaces for each rally. Daily walking around local industrial estates and door knocking Louise managed to get 300 companies to sponsor her £50 enough to get her first season and career underway in 2010 . 
Large sacrifices had to be made ; Louise had to sell her much loved Ford StreetKa road car to get to the first round , she gave up her security of full-time job to commit fully and most recently sold her trophies on eBay all to fund her career .
